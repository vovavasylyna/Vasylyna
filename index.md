# Volodymyr Vasylyna's Website

Hi, you've reached my personal corner of the Internet.
I work as an analyst at <a href="https://sap.com">SAP</a> based in Kyiv, Ukraine. I love quiet rest in the mountains and keeping things simple. On my blog, I share thoughts and ideas about personal development, [books](books.html), work, digital minimalism, and more.
